React ES6 Classes:-
ES6 introduced classes.
class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it,
we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.
A simple class constructor:
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}
Notice the case of the class name. We have begun the name, "Car", with an uppercase character. This is a standard naming convention for classes.
