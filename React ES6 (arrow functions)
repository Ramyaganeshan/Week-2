Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions.
You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets.
Example: let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b;

Before Arrow:
hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}
It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement,
and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:
Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:
hello = () => "Hello World!";
**Note: This works only if the function has only one statement.**

Arrow Function With Parameters:
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;

In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:

Arrow Function Without Parentheses:
hello = val => "Hello " + val;
